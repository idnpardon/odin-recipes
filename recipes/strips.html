<p>Chicken strips are crispy fried pieces of chicken breast coated in a flavorful breading. They’re golden on the outside, tender inside, and perfect for dipping in sauces. A quick and easy recipe for lunch, dinner, or a party snack.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast — 500 g</li>
        <li>Flour — 100 g (about ¾ cup)</li>
        <li>Carrots — 3–4 pcs</li>
        <li>Eggs — 2 pcs</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs — 150 g</li>
        <li>Salt — 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Black pepper — ½ tsp</li>
        <li>Paprika — 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Garlic powder — ½ tsp</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil — for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken breasts into long, even strips. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Rub the mixture onto the chicken strips.</li>
        <li>Dip each strip in flour, then in egg, and finally coat with bread crumbs. Press lightly so the coating sticks well.</li>
        <li>Pour enough oil into a frying pan to cover the bottom (about 1–2 cm). Heat on medium-high until hot.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken strips in batches for about 3–4 minutes per side until golden and crispy. Don’t overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked strips on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
    </ol>
