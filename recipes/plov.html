<p>Plov (pilaf) is one of the most popular Eastern dishes made from rice, meat, and aromatic spices. It combines rich flavor, tender meat, and fluffy rice. This dish is perfect for a family dinner or a festive table.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice — 500 g (preferably long-grain, like basmati)</li>
        <li>Meat (lamb or beef) — 500–600 g</li>
        <li>Carrots — 3–4 pcs</li>
        <li>Onions — 2 pcs</li>
        <li>Garlic — 1 head</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil — 100 ml</li>
        <li>Salt — to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper — to taste</li>
        <li>Cumin — 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Water — 600 ml</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into medium cubes, slice the onions into half rings, and cut the carrots into thin strips. Rinse the rice in cold water 3–4 times until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>In a cauldron or deep pan, heat the vegetable oil until it slightly smokes.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and fry on high heat until golden brown (about 7–10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Sauté the onions until translucent, then add the carrots and fry for another 5–7 minutes until soft.</li>
        <li>Add salt, cumin, barberry, and black pepper. Stir well so the meat and vegetables absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Pour in hot water to cover the meat. Cover with a lid and simmer for 20–25 minutes on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Gently spread the rice on top of the meat and vegetables without stirring. Pour in hot water so it covers the rice by about 1.5–2 cm. Salt the top lightly.</li>
        <li>Cook uncovered over medium heat until the water is absorbed (10–15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Insert the whole peeled garlic head into the center of the rice. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook for another 20–25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let the plov rest covered for 10 minutes. Then gently mix from bottom to top before serving.</li>
    </ol>
