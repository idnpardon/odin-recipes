    <p>Manti is a slow-cooking dish consisting of large steamed dumplings filled with meat (or pumpkin or cheese), spices, and onions, encased in thin dough and steamed in a pre-cooked pot called a manti-maker. They are distinguished by the juiciness of the filling, which often includes pieces of lard or finely chopped meat.</p>
